Functionality

To access pages, run server, such as Node.js http-server, from project directory. Navigate to http://localhost:8080. 

After at least one input field is filled out, a user can make a search request. A search returns searchResults.json, which is then parsed to return entries matching input parameters. Remaining results are displayed.

If a details file exists in the "data" folder for a patient, clicking the "Details" link below the patient summary will direct the user to a page with more patient information. A patient's details page must match his or her EUID.
